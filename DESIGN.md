# Terminal Manager design

## Intent

Terminal Manager primarily serves agents in the background. Olof's occasional UI visits are
for finding recent projects, stopping accumulated services, and removing unwanted
registrations; manual starts are secondary and reading logs is uncommon. Prioritize
a scannable overview and cleanup actions. Preserve the shared runtime contract and
keep project/service output available as a detail view. Configuration stays agent-led.

The landing page is DR-OVERVIEW. DR-WORKSPACE remains available at `/project`
for service inspection, logs, and secondary project removal.

## Direction and ownership

[Made by Olof](https://www.madebyolof.com) is the selected **directional** reference
for charcoal surfaces, neutral text, warm gold-orange actions, DM Sans, and restrained
surface treatment. The palette is adapted from its local
`src/styles/global.css`; Terminal Manager owns its copy in
[`src/styles/olof-theme.css`](src/styles/olof-theme.css).
Do not carry over the personal portrait, Lora wordmark, hero animation, marketing
scale, or narrow editorial layout. Commands and output retain monospace type.
Local DM Sans font files and their OFL license live in `public/fonts/`.

The approved theme applies to the workspace and the development reference at
[/design](http://localhost:4317/design). The reference is unavailable in production
and has no API or process effects. Its controls simulate state locally.

## Approved palette

Five everyday colors: canvas `#101114`, surface `#1c1e23`, primary text `#f2f3f5`,
secondary text `#a1a7b0`, and orange `#f6b743`. Green `#9ad5bd` and red `#efaaa3`
are reserved for meaningful success/error states. Derive divider and hover shades
from these colors; use canvas for text on orange. Body and secondary copy share one
text color. A warning may reuse orange; starting is informational and should be
neutral in the redesigned workspace. Keep explicit status text, never color alone.
Olof approved this palette on 28 September 2026.

## Surface specifications

### DR-REFERENCE — implemented study

- Owner: `src/app/design/page.tsx`, `src/components/design/DesignReference.tsx`.
- Present direction, actual theme tokens, type samples, real controls, and workspace principles.
- Render production `CommandBar` and `HistoryPanel` with deterministic sample props.
- Offer legacy/approved theme selection, stateful safe actions, and reset.
- Keep the shared controls aligned with the implemented workspace.
- Fit 390px and 1440px viewports and retain visible keyboard focus.
- Coverage excludes the full live terminal, Open app/Open log actions, and configuration forms.

### DR-WORKSPACE — implemented

- Owners: `src/app/project/page.tsx`, `src/components/{Sidebar,ProjectHeader,CommandBar,TerminalPanel,HistoryPanel}.tsx`.
- Bound the desktop shell to the viewport; project list and output scroll independently.
- Use quiet project rows, readable names, search, and explicit ready/starting/error status.
- Combine project identity and service actions into one compact workspace header.
- Make Start primary when stopped; promote Open app when ready with a verified URL.
- Keep Remove available in a project menu. Configuration belongs to agents via the API;
  do not build a manual configuration form. Make history optional; retain visible failures.
- On phones, use a project chooser above the service view rather than placing every project before output.
- Apply the Olof theme; read terminal canvas, text, and selection colors from its tokens.
- Refit the terminal when its container changes, including history opening/closing.
- Hide manual Add/Configure controls; empty states explain agent-led setup.
- Stop remains available while starting. Hide redundant Start for running services;
  show Restart only while running. Disable controls while an action is pending.
- Preserve service switching, logs, history, run identity, and all runtime API semantics.

### DR-OVERVIEW — implemented

- Owners: `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/hooks/useProjectOverview.ts`, `src/lib/overview.ts`.
- Landing view: subtle full-width project cards showing name, named running services, last start,
  running duration, and contextual Start/Stop/Open app actions. Open project detail
  for terminal output and history; do not load every terminal just to review projects.
- Group each project on the surface color with an 8px radius, no border or shadow,
  and 16px between cards. Use stronger project names and subordinate paths/recency.
  Align service status, duration, and actions on desktop, retaining the action column
  when Open app is absent. Reflow service information and actions on mobile.
  Stop is a borderless text button with a full click target, subtle hover fill, and
  visible keyboard focus; do not add outlined controls or nested service cards.
- Offer All / Running independently from sort order. Default to Running with recent
  starts first on initial entry, with longest-running first available for cleanup.
  Keep a stable tie-break and preserve selection during refreshes.
- Project recency means its most recent service start, including agent starts.
  Within a project show duration per service; a longest-running project sort uses
  its oldest currently running service, not the most recently restarted one.
- Read startedAt from runtime state. For stopped services with missing timestamps,
  recover the latest retained start event through history (cached by service/run).
  History-store reload was verified; show unknown when retained history has no start.
  Never equate a creation date, quiet logs, or a long run with last use or inactivity.
- Allow stopping a named running service directly from the overview. Keep the row
  pending until confirmed, surface failures inline, and handle rows leaving Running
  after success without losing track of which action completed. Reflect agent changes.
- Keep removal secondary and explicitly separate from Stop. Explain its registration,
  configuration, and history effects without suggesting repository deletion.
- Retain the approved palette and adapt rows for mobile. No new dashboard metrics,
  automatic shutdown, or bulk controls in the first pass.
- Validation: use a large registry with multiple services per project, mixed run
  ages, stopped projects, unknown timestamps, and agent-initiated changes. Verify
  sorting/filtering, stopping the intended service, later restart with intact config,
  failures/stale data, keyboard access, and desktop/mobile layout.

## Evidence and workflow

[Design review](docs/design-review.md) owns findings, decisions, and validation.
[Harness integration](docs/design-harness.md) owns commands and evidence locations.
Follow the installed [workflow](tools/design-harness/modules/workflow/README.md) and
[reference guide](tools/design-harness/modules/workflow/design-reference.md).
Inspect original desktop/mobile captures. Passing checks establish behavior and
capture completeness; Olof decides visual acceptance.
